# Object-classification
An object classification project by using the VGG-16 and Keras API.
What is VGG neural network?
VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. We have VGG-19 and 16, each one is used in CNN in the same way, the only difference is 16 has less layers than 19. This pretrained models have been trained on millions of models.
To install VGG Pip - pip install vgg-pytorch.
Keras is the most widely used API for Deep learning because of all its tools and pretrained models.
To install keras - pip install keras
